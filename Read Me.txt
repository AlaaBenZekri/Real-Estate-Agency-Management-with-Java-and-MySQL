The Agence.jar executable file is to be used if your MySql has root as its name
username and root as the password, the Agence1.jar file is to be used
if your MySql has no password.

For database import you can write the following command
in your command window when opened from the bin folder located
in MySQL Server in the MySQL folder in your program folder:

mysql -u username -ppassword dbname < dump_agenceF.sql

Thank you and we hope you like the application :D .
